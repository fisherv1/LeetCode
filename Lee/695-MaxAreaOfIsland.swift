import Foundation
//You are given an m x n binary matrix grid. An island is a group of 1's (representing land) connected 4-directionally (horizontal or vertical.) You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.
//
//The area of an island is the number of cells with a value 1 in the island.
//
//Return the maximum area of an island in grid. If there is no island, return 0.
//
//
//Example 2:
//Input: grid = [[0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],[0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0],[0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0]]
//Output: 6
//Explanation: The answer is not 11, because the island must be connected 4-directionally.
//Example 2:
//
//Input: grid = [[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]]
//Output: 0
