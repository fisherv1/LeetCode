//You are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top.
//
//Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?
//
//Example 1:
//
//Input: n = 2
//Output: 2
//Explanation: There are two ways to climb to the top.
//1. 1 step + 1 step
//2. 2 steps
//Example 2:
//
//Input: n = 3
//Output: 3
//Explanation: There are three ways to climb to the top.
//1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
//2. 1 step + 2 steps
//3. 2 steps + 1 step
